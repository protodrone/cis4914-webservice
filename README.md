# The Tarlington Project&trade;

# Abstract
Current trends in natural history biological specimen collection increasingly focus on collecting 
event metadata, such as two-dimensional imaging and GIS, to facilitate use of the specimen and 
collecting event in broader scope ecological research. Whereas specimen collection of the past 
could emphasize specimen preservation, modern research demands precision metadata to place the 
collecting event in context of space and time. Spatial location and imaging tools have advanced 
dramatically in recent decades and transitioned to digital paradigms. Although these digital 
measurement tools have become ubiquitous in the modern world, the collecting event metadata pipeline 
has not kept pace with the digital revolution and is largely still relegated to the analog world of 
paper field logs. Inefficiency and error are inherent to human transcription of analog data, resulting 
in lower quality data that takes longer to ingest into museum collection databases and publish to 
the research community.

To resolve this problem and help the collecting community bridge the digital paradigm shift, The Tarlington Project&trade; Collecting Companion Field Log has been created. The project provides a software 
solution for collecting institutions to implement a digital data pipeline from the field to collection 
databases. The developed iOS app replaces traditional paper field logs and leverages the mobile device 
camera and GPS for direct digital data acquisition. Batches of collected specimens or observations may 
be uploaded to the companion webservice over cellular or WiFi with a screen tap. Collection 
managers may logon to the webservice and download the submitted batches and images in an appropriate 
format for ingestion into institutional databases. The project is released to the collecting community 
and public at large.

The Tarlington Project&trade; was developed by [Warren H. Brown](http://warrenhbrown.com "Warren H. Brown's website") as a senior project in the 
[Computer Science (CSC) program](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/academics/undergraduate/academic-programs/bachelors-degree-programs/ "Computer Science at UF") at the [University of Florida](https://ufl.edu "University of Florida") during the fall of 2019. 

The author wishes to thank [Dr. Peter J. Dobbins](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/dobbins-peter "Peter J. Dobbins Faculty Website") for for his patience, guidance, wisdom, early morning schedule, and academic encouragement. Additional thanks to the [Florida Museum of Natural History](https://floridamuseum.ufl.edu "Florida Museum of Natural History") Collection Managers, Ichthyology Collection Manager [Robert H. Robins](https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/museum-voices/rob-robins/ "Robert H. Robin's staff page") for his design input and agreement to beta test the app in early 2020, and to Dr. Scott A. Wilson for his support and encouragement.

# Technical
The Collecting Companion Field Log webservice is written in Python Django. Required libraries are listed in
requirements.txt. Use of a Python Virtual Environment is recommended as is pip install -r requirements.txt.

Fresh installs will need to review and configure settings.py appropriately, make and install migrations, create a superuser, and create the following groups:
* is_api_authorized
* is_download_authorized

Membership in these groups controls api and batch download access, respectively. The Django admin control panel is used for group and user management. 

For obvious reasons, it is strongly recommended that the webservice be deployed via HTTPS only.
